Shrimp cooks so quickly that it's easy to overcook, but you won't have that problem in this saucy shrimp saut√© because the technique preserves the shrimp's tender interior and boosts its delicate flavor. It's important to start with a good sear, which guarantees moist, succulent results. 

## Ingredients 

* 1 lb. shrimp (21 to 25 per lb.), peeled, deveined, rinsed, and patted dry 
* 3/4 tsp. kosher salt; more as needed 
* Freshly ground black pepper 
* 1 lemon 
* 6 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil 
* 4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced 
* 3/4 lb. asparagus, bottoms snapped off, halved lengthwise if thick, and cut into 2-inch lengths (2 cups) 
* 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes 
* 2/3 cup low-salt chicken broth 
* 1/2 tsp. cornstarch

## Preparation 

* Sprinkle the shrimp with a scant 1/4 tsp. salt and a few generous grinds of black pepper. Using a peeler, gently shave the zest in strips from the lemon, taking care not to get any of the bitter white pith. Squeeze the lemon to get 1 Tbs. juice. 

Put a 12-inch skillet (not nonstick) over medium-high heat for 1-1/2 minutes. Add 2 Tbs. of the oil and once it's shimmering hot, add the shrimp in a single layer. Cook undisturbed until the shrimp browns nicely, about 2 minutes. Flip the shrimp and brown the second side, about 1-1/2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. The shrimp should be a little undercooked. 

Reduce the heat to medium, add the remaining 4 Tbs. oil and the garlic and cook, tossing, until the garlic starts to sizzle steadily, about 30 seconds. Add the asparagus, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes, sprinkle with 1/2 tsp. salt and cook, tossing often, until the garlic is golden brown and the asparagus looks blistery in places, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth, cover, with the lid ajar, and cook until the asparagus is just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. 

In a small dish, whisk together the cornstarch with 1 Tbs. water, stir into the asparagus mixture, and bring to a boil. Stir in the shrimp, reduce the heat to low, and cook, tossing, until the shrimp is opaque throughout (cut one in half to check), 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the 1 Tbs. lemon juice and then add salt, pepper, and additional lemon juice to taste. Serve immediately. 

Pair with rice, noodles, or a [Bright, Herby Orzo][2].
